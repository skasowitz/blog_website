## Hi!

Thanks for visiting my site and blog.

I'm a scientist with a deep passion for data analysis and visualization. At Addgene, the non-profit life science resource and repository, I helped accelerate scientific research as a senior support scientist and bioinformatics data scientist. This followed long academic adventures in genetics, reproductive biology, and RNA biogenesis.

This site is intended as a place to share and explore all things data. Be it clean-up and imputation, exploratory analytics, visualization, or machine learning, I hope to showcase interesting and fun demonstrations with `Quarto`.
